<h1 align="center"> Peptide Parameter Generator </h1>
<h2 align="center"> This is bash script that generates the count of aromatic,  polar, non polar, acidic and basic residues from a text file containing the peptide sequences.</h2>

# Instructions:
- Download the paramgen.sh file
- Copy all your peptides sequences in a text file

- Place it in the same folder as the paramge.sh file
- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the the script and text file is located or open a terminal directly from the location of the folder
- Make the paramgen.sh script executable (if not already) by typing
```bash
chmod +x paramgen.sh
```
- Finally, run the script by typing
```bash
# ./paramgen.sh <type_your_filename>
# For example if you saved the peptide sequences in peptides.txt file
./paramgen.sh peptides.txt
```
- A tsv file will be generated named peptide_param.tsv
- Open the file in excel
